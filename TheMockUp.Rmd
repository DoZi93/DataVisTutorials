# Tables in R

Practices based on the blog post of Thomas Mock https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-09-04-10-table-rules-in-r/

This post is mainly about the R package "gt" (*g*rammar of *t*ables) which can
be used to create tables of tabular data. It also shows how to combine 
tables with plots. For grammar tables for statistical model output, the package
*gtsummary* is to be used.
